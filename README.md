04    | Treat missing values using different techniques in Python <br>
05    | Implement various data flow transformations used in ETL processes <br>
06    | Understand and implement OLAP operations on a multi-dimensional data cube <br>
07    | Implement Apriori Algorithm to find frequent itemsets from a dataset <br>
08    | Implement Naïve Bayes Algorithm <br>
09    | Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm <br> 
10    | To Implement K-means clustering data mining algorithm <br>  

11    | To Implement decision tree for a data set <br>
12    | To Implement Linear Regression <br>

#### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Weka (for algorithm implementations)

#### 📈 Learning Outcomes
